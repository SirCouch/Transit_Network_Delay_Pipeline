## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- ALWAYS ask the user for architectural decisions and design decisions, provide options if they don't know, but get explicit approval on architectural decisions and design decisions
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `planning/lessons.md` with the pattern
- ALWAYS pattern implementation using galls law: all functioning complex systems develop from simple systems that worked, while complex systems designed from scratch never work and cannot be patched to function
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `planning/todo.md` with checkable items uses `researcher.md` during planning to test your plan and make sure it is based in reality with cited references. pattern implementation using galls law: all functioning complex systems develop from simple systems that worked, while complex systems designed from scratch never work and cannot be patched to function
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation uses `researcher.md` and `/context` to verify your plan
3. **implementation**: Execute your plan. Step one assign agents to write unit tests, these test need to be hidden. Step two, implement features with agents team THEY MUST NEVER SEE THE UNIT TESTS. Step three, use agent to test features with unit tests. DO NOT CREATE FEATURES TO PASS TESTS. TESTS MUST ALWAYS BE REPRESENTATIVE OF INTENDED USE CASE FROM PRD OR OTHER DESIGN DOCUMENTS.
4. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
5. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
6. **Document Results**: Add review section to `planning/todo.md`
7. **Capture Lessons**: Update `planning/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
